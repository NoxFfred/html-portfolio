<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I spend about half of my time as a freelance Finance / Business Management Consultant.</p>

<p>During the other half of my time I work as a freelance
   retro video game developer. I developed the most technically advanced game
   ever created for the Apple II computer, release in December 2020, called Nox Archaist.
   To my delight, it was endorsed by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

<p>I am working on a sequel, Nox Archaist II - Dragonsmere. As part of this project
  I working on developing better toolchain apps. I am learning about web development for this project
  so that I can deploy these apps as web apps, shareable with my teammates.
